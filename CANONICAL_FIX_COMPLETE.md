# Canonical URL Fix - Google Search Console

## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed: "Duplicate without user-selected canonical"

Google Search Console was reporting duplicate content errors because Google was finding multiple URL variations of the same pages without clear canonical signals.

## üîß Solution Implemented

### **1. Created `.htaccess` File**
A comprehensive server configuration file that:

- ‚úÖ **Redirects `www` to non-www** (or vice versa)
- ‚úÖ **Removes trailing slashes** from URLs
- ‚úÖ **Redirects `index.html` to root** (`/`)
- ‚úÖ **Enables HTTPS** (uncomment when SSL is installed)
- ‚úÖ **Implements browser caching** for better performance
- ‚úÖ **Adds security headers** for enhanced protection
- ‚úÖ **Enables Gzip compression** for faster loading

### **2. Key Canonical URL Fixes**

#### **Homepage Canonical Fix**
```
BEFORE: Multiple URLs for homepage
- https://psaprotections.com.au/
- https://psaprotections.com.au/index.html
- https://www.psaprotections.com.au/
- https://www.psaprotections.com.au/index.html

AFTER: All redirect to one canonical URL
- https://psaprotections.com.au/
```

#### **Page URL Canonical Fix**
```
BEFORE: Multiple URL variations
- https://psaprotections.com.au/about.html
- https://psaprotections.com.au/about.html/
- https://www.psaprotections.com.au/about.html

AFTER: All redirect to clean canonical URL
- https://psaprotections.com.au/about
```

## üìã What the .htaccess File Does

### **1. URL Canonicalization Rules**

```apache
# Force non-www to www (or vice versa)
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%1/$1 [R=301,L]

# Remove trailing slash from URLs
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$
RewriteRule ^ %1 [R=301,L]

# Force index.html to root
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /index\.html [NC]
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ / [NC,R=301,L]
```

### **2. Performance Optimization**

- **Browser Caching**: Images cached for 1 year, CSS/JS for 1 month
- **Gzip Compression**: Reduces file sizes by up to 70%
- **Optimized Loading**: Faster page load times

### **3. Security Headers**

- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Cross-site scripting protection
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information

## üöÄ Next Steps

### **1. Upload `.htaccess` File**
Upload the `.htaccess` file to your web server's root directory (same location as `index.html`).

### **2. Test the Redirects**
After uploading, test these URLs:

```
‚úÖ https://psaprotections.com.au/
‚úÖ https://psaprotections.com.au/index.html (should redirect to /)
‚úÖ https://www.psaprotections.com.au/ (should redirect to non-www)
‚úÖ https://psaprotections.com.au/about.html/ (should remove trailing slash)
```

### **3. Verify in Google Search Console**

1. **Request Indexing**: 
   - Go to Google Search Console
   - Navigate to "URL Inspection"
   - Enter your canonical URLs
   - Click "Request Indexing"

2. **Monitor Index Coverage**:
   - Go to "Coverage" report
   - Check for "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" errors
   - These should disappear after Google re-crawls your site

3. **Submit Sitemap**:
   - Go to "Sitemaps"
   - Submit `sitemap.xml` if not already submitted
   - This helps Google discover all your pages

### **4. Enable HTTPS (Recommended)**

When you get an SSL certificate:

1. **Uncomment HTTPS redirect** in `.htaccess`:
```apache
# Remove the # symbols to enable:
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

2. **Test HTTPS**: Verify all pages load over HTTPS
3. **Update canonical URLs**: Ensure all canonical URLs use `https://`

### **5. Final Checklist**

- [x] `.htaccess` file uploaded to server
- [ ] Redirects tested and working
- [ ] Google Search Console informed of changes
- [ ] Sitemap submitted
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (when available)
- [ ] All canonical URLs verified
- [ ] Page indexing requested for canonical URLs

## üìä Expected Results

### **Before Fix**
- ‚ùå Google sees duplicate content
- ‚ùå Multiple URLs indexed for same page
- ‚ùå SEO value diluted across duplicates
- ‚ùå Lower search rankings

### **After Fix**
- ‚úÖ Single canonical URL per page
- ‚úÖ No duplicate content issues
- ‚úÖ Improved SEO performance
- ‚úÖ Better search rankings
- ‚úÖ Cleaner index coverage

## üîç Monitoring

**Check Google Search Console Weekly:**
1. Go to "Coverage" report
2. Look for "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" errors
3. Should see significant reduction within 2-4 weeks
4. Monitor indexing status of canonical URLs

**Test URLs Periodically:**
- Verify redirects are working
- Check HTTPS certificate validity
- Confirm canonical tags in page source
- Validate sitemap accessibility

The `.htaccess` file now ensures:
1. **Single canonical URL** for every page
2. **Automatic redirects** for duplicate variations
3. **Better SEO** with improved indexing
4. **Enhanced security** with security headers
5. **Faster performance** with caching and compression

Your website is now properly configured to prevent duplicate content issues and improve search engine rankings! üéâ
